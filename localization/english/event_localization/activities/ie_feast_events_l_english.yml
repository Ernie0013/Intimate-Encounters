 ie_feast.1000.desc:0 "I wake up after a long night of feasting. My memories are a bit hazy — maybe I feasted a bit too much — but from what I can remember I had a great time. There is nothing better in the world than to eat, to drink, and to be merry.\n\nYawning, I rub the sleep from my eyes. Only then do I realize I am not alone in bed. Heat radiates from a body next to mine."

 ie_feast.1001.desc:0 "I turn around and stare right into the eyes of a beautiful — yet unknown [stranger.GetWomanMan]. A broad smile appears on [stranger.GetHerHis] face. My eyes trail down, but I quickly avert them when I notice [stranger.GetHerHis] naked form.\n\n"What's wrong, my Liege?" [stranger.GetSheHe] asks. "Last night you couldn't get enough of my body."\n\nThe [stranger.GetWomanMan] folds the covers away, revealing [stranger.GetHerHis] gorgeous naked body fully to me."
